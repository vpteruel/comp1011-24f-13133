## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK 21 or later)
- JavaFX SDK
- MySQL Server
- Maven (for managing dependencies)
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-system.git
   ```

2. **Set up the MySQL database**:
   - Create a new MySQL database with the following details:
     - **Database Name**: `hotel_booking`
   - Use the following SQL script to create tables:

   ```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rooms (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        room_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
        room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
        is_available BOOLEAN NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bookings (
        id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        room_id INT NOT NULL,
        customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        start_date DATE NOT NULL,
        end_date DATE NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES rooms(id)
    );
   ```

3. **Configure your MySQL database connection in `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://your-hostname:3306/hotel_booking
   DB_USER=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   - Use Maven to build the project and resolve dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the project**:
   - Launch the JavaFX application through your IDE or using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```
